# MyDroneApp

I made a Drone App that connects an Android phone to a Raspberry Pi drone via SSH. Still a work in progress!

# How to download the project

Open up the command panel/terminal, click the bright green button in Github that says Code and type 'git clone' followed by the link in the https url.
